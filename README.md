## About me
As a Quality Assurance Analyst, I bring expertise in both manual and automation testing.
I have hands-on experience in seamlessly integrating Cypress, a JavaScript framework, with GitLab CI/CD pipelines for efficient and automated testing processes.
Proficient in API testing with tools like Postman and GraphQL, I ensure comprehensive testing coverage.
Well-versed in effective collaboration using tools such as Jira, I follow agile methodologies to enhance project efficiency.
Currently expanding my skill set by learning TOSCA and Selenium automation tools.
